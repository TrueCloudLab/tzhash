# Homomorphic hashing in golang

Package `tz` contains pure-Go (with some Assembly) implementation of hashing
function described by [Tillich and
ZÃ©mor](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-48658-5_5.pdf).

There are [existing implementations](https://github.com/srijs/hwsl2-core)
already, however they are written in C.

Package `gf127` contains arithmetic in `GF(2^127)` with `x^127+x^63+1` as reduction polynomial.

# Description

TZ Hash can be used instead of Merkle-tree for data-validation, because
homomorphic hashes are concatenable: hash sum of data can be calculated based on
hashes of chunks.

The example of how it works can be seen in tests and demo.
